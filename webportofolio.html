  <h1> Gilberto Cotzajay</h1>

  <p>I was born in California. I enlisted in the United States Navy in 2008 as an aircraft mechanic  
    completing Two tours supporting Operation Enduring Freedom. In 2017, I attended college 
    at Temple University Japan campus where I graduated in June 2020. In the same year I was hired at SpaceX as Propulsion technician 
    for the Starship.

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <bh></bh>

    <p>I was raised in Southern California where I currently live. I grew up in the San Francisco Valley, 
      those who know the greater Los Angeles area will know that this place is located in the
      North-West side of Downtown Los Angeles or around an hour driving north on the 5 freeway.
      I will say that my life change after my family move to ventura county in 2006. 
      Starting school mid-year in 2006 and I attended Simi Valley High School where I graduated in 2008.
      After graduating from high school I decided to join the armed forces and follow into my uncle's steps
      in serving the country. I joined the US Navy working with aircrafts as a mechanic in power plants. 
      This was a cool job while I was in, I was able to travel the world visiting Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. 
      After serving 8 years I realized that the military was not my future. So, I decided to attended college in Japan. 
      I was on my last semester in the beggining of 2020, I was ready to graduate but as we know our lives change due to the pandemic
      of COVID-19 I was not able to celebrate my graduation so I was advised to return to America so I would'nt have any future problems
      in a foreign country. I came back and I was not ready to work in what studied, so applied to jobs based on my military experience. 
      I was hired few months after graduation on a avition company doing mechanical repeairs on aircrafts similar to what did in the military.
      It was not too long after that the company fail to win another contract so I was realeased from that job. Then applied to SpaceX and I was successfully transferred
      hired and while I worked at SpaceX I found out that anyone who had a STEM education had an opportunity to work for with a higher pay compare to what I was getting pay.

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p> I do have some hobbies that I like to do but I would not considered them as hobbies but mostly as ramdom things that I like to do 
      when I want to learn or find out more information about something new or just because. Here are some of the topics I usually I search about:  </p>
      <br
    <ul>
      <li>Science</li>
      <li>Education</li>
      <li>Sports</li>
      <li>Music</li>
      <li>News</li>
      <li>Politics</li>
      <li>Technology</li>
    </ul>
    <br> 
  </bh>
    <form action="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/299219">
      <Please></Please> select which of the hobbies above should I spend more time learning about:</Please>

    <h2>Future plans</h2>
    <p>During my short time back in America, I accepted that plans changes and I was not doing what I planned. My initial plan was to
      to work for the State Department, but COVID-19 affected those plans too. So I relied on my military experience, but also it was not 
      enough for me to get a secure job with all the changes that society was going through. Then I remember that I received an email back in 2019 from SpaceX saying 
      that I fit a description for an opening so I decided to applied and see what would happen. Long story short, I was hired as a propulsion technician for the Raptor engines which are still under- experimantal development. 
      Well, now what is next, 
      I decided to started college again by getting my BS in Computer Science. But after 4 months I had enough and I wanted to start working as soon as possible. 
      I put my college on pause until I really need a degree in Computer Science. Now I'm attending Coding Temple (similar name to my previous university) to achive 
      the hands on the actual job that I want to execute in the future. </p>
